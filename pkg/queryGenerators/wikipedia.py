with the same weights:
if "events" has 20 links and "births" has 40 links

How the math works:
"events" weight is 4 and has 20 links
each link will be added to the search pool 4 times generating 80 event links

after a link is chosen from the pool to be returned as a query
all other instances of the link are removed
